Algorithm for Sequential File Allocation:
Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: Get the number of memory partition and their sizes.
Step 3: Get the number of processes and values of block size for each process.
Step 4: First fit algorithm searches all the entire memory block until a hole which is big enough is encountered. It allocates that memory block for the requesting process.
Step 5: Best-fit algorithm searches the memory blocks for the smallest hole which can be allocated to requesting process and allocates it.
Step 6: Worst fit algorithm searches the memory blocks for the largest hole and allocates it to the process.
Step 7: Analyses all the three memory management techniques and display the best algorithm which utilizes the memory resources effectively and efficiently.
Step 8: Stop the program.
