FCFS (First-Come-First-Served) algorithm services 
the disk requests in the order in which they arrive. 
Therefore, a requestâ€™s position in the queue is 
unaffected by arriving requests. This ensures that a 
request cannot be postponed indefinitely, but it also 
means that FCFS might perform a long-winded seek 
operation to service the next request, even though 
another request in the queue is closer and can be 
serviced faster.
