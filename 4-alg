ALGORITHM:
Step1: Start the process.
Step2: Declarevariables.
Step3: Enter total memory size ms.

Step4: Allocate memory for os.
             Ms=ms-os
Step5: Read the no partition to be divided n Partition size=ms/n.
Step6: Read the process no and process size.
Step 7: If process size is less than partition size allot alse blocke the process. While allocating update memory wastage-external fragmentation.
